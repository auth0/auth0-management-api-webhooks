# Auth0 Management API Webhooks

## Move Notice
Beginning with the `2.2` release of this extension, we have moved from separate repositories for each of the logging extensions to building and deploying via a single `auth0-logs-to-provider` monorepo. This approach will make maintenance and issue tracking across all logging extensions much easier for Auth0 and more timely for our customers.

The new monorepo can be found here: [auth0-logs-to-provider](https://github.com/auth0-extensions/auth0-logs-to-provider)
